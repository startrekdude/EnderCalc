EnderCalc is a fast, powerful, arbitrary precision, text-driven scientific calculator written in (almost) pure C99. It supports basic arithmetic, logarithms and roots, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, statistics functions, and much more (a full reference is available in [reference.pdf](reference.pdf)).

## Download
